# Vue Calculator App

## Getting started

From the project root, run `npm install` to set up dependencies.

To launch the application, you can then run `npm run start`. This will create a local dev server using Vite - you will see a URL in your console like `http://localhost:3000`.

The app contains a form with a number input and a log of all requests that have been made during this page load. Just enter a number into the number input and submit the form to see the result added to the log.

## Tests

There are unit and component tests. Run these with the command `npm run test`.
